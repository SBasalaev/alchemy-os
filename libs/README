These are the symbols and headers for the native libraries of Alchemy OS.
These libraries are implemented as Java classes and embedded in resulting
jar so they are licensed under GPL v3 as the rest of MIDlet. However, the
following exception applies to programs that link with these libraries
dynamically:

 Linking any of these libraries dynamically with other modules is making
 a combined work based on these libraries. Thus, the terms and conditions
 of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

 As a special exception, the copyright holders of these libraries give you
 permission to link these libraries with independent modules to produce an
 executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
 and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
 choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
 the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent
 module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If
 you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
 the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do
 so, delete this exception statement from your version.
